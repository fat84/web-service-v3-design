% MusicBrainz Web Service, Version 3

# MusicBrainz Web Service, Version 3

This document describes the programming interface provided by the third version
of the MusicBrainz API. The guiding design principle of the API is [REST][], so
if you are familiar with this paradigm, then the web service should feel natural
to you.

[REST]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer

## Access

* All access to the web service is conducted over HTTP 1.1.
* All calls are around a base URL of http://musicbrainz.org/ws/3/
* Access to the web service is rate limited. The details of how rate limiting
  works can be found in section on [rate limiting](#rate-limiting).
* All request and response bodies are encoded as UTF-8 JSON, to be served with
  the `application/json` mime-type.
* Data is heavily hyperlinked, allowing you to easily move between data.

### Error handling

The majority of end points all share some common behaviour for error
handling. The following status codes are used:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Code Explanation
---- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
400  A parameter in the request URI could not be parsed, or the request body
     could not be parsed

401  You attempted to request a resource either without authenticating, or are
     authenticated as a user without permission for this resource.

429  The client has sent too many requests, and has gone over their rate limit.

500  Our servers could not process the request, but it was well-formed. If this
     error frequently occurs, please file a
     [bug](http://tickets.musicbrainz.org) report.

503  Our servers are currently overloaded and unable to process the request. This
     is also sent if we couldn't process the request in a timely fashion. If
     this error frequently occurs, please file a
     [bug](http://tickets.musicbrainz.org) report.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the case of these errors, the body of the response will also include a
descriptive error message, served as `application/json`:

``` {.json .numberLines}
{
    "error": text
}
```

### Rate Limiting

I still need to write this up. General idea:

* Adaptive rate limiter; rate limit changes after every request.
* Requests are cost based - the longer it takes to compute the data, the more it
  costs against the rate limiter.
* Receiving 304 and thus using cache control headers does not incur a cost at
  all.
* Rate limit daemon 'refills' rate limits depending on aggregate server load.

## JSON Patterns

We follow a couple of patterns with the JSON representation, throughout the web
service:

* All end points document a minimum complete response that documents the full
  schema you can expect back. These example responses are minimal in that the
  lists will contain at most 1 element. The values of properties are the data
  type that this property can hold; see the section on [types](#types) if you
  need more detail about a specific type. Properties marked with a `?` suffix
  may also take `null` as a value.
* Paginated lists are represented as a JSON object, with properties for the
  first page, next page, previous page, last page, the total item count, and the
  items themselves. For more details, see [paginated lists](#paginated-lists) in
  the type reference.


## End Points

This section of documentation pertains to the public facing end points that
developers can make requests against. Each end point documents:

* The HTTP methods that can be used to call it.
* A summary of what that method does against that end point.

## Types

This appendix contains a list of types used by the web service. All types have a
description, and where possible, their augmented Backus-Naur form syntax (as
defined by [RFC 5234][]).

[RFC 5234]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5234

### Core Entity

A core entity in MusicBrainz is an entity that has (at least):

* One or more [MBID](#mbid)s.
* The ability to be edited by editors.

There are currently 7 core entities in MusicBrainz:

* Artists
* Labels
* Recordings
* Releases
* Release groups
* URLs
* Works

### Paginated lists

### `date-range`

A date range in MusicBrainz has 3 components: a start date, an end date, and a
boolean asserting whether or not this date range has ended. The boolean is
necessary because there are various entities in MusicBrainz where either the
start or end (or both) dates are not known, but it _is_ known that the entity is
no longer active.

A `date-range` is a JSON object:

``` {.json .numberLines}
"date-range": {
  "start": partial-date?,
  "end": partial-date?,
  "ended": boolean
}
```

Where

```
partial_date = (4DIGIT / "") "-" (2DIGIT / "") "-" (2DIGIT / "")
```

It's important to note that partial dates are just that, _partial_. You may
encounter dates that have only a year, or dates that consist of a year and a
day.

### `direction`

Indicates whether a relationship is forwards - pointing _towards_ another entity
- or backwards - pointing _from_ another entity.

```
direction = "forward" / "backward"
```

### `entity-type`

Used to specify which type of [core entity](#core-entity) one is referring to.

```
entity-type = "artist" / "label" /" recording" / "release" / "release-group" /
              "url" / "work"
```

### `MBID`

A MusicBrainz identifier that can be used for looking up various
[core entities](#core-entity).

```
mbid = 8HEXDIG "-" 4HEXDIG "-" 4HEXDIG "-" 4HEXDIG "-" "-" 12HEXDIG

```

### `nonnegative-integer`

An integer that is either 0 or positive.

### `single-line`

A text string that does not have leading or trailing whitespace, runs of
multiple whitespace characters, or newlines.

# Open Questions

## HTTP or HTTPS?

Github mandate that all requests are served over HTTPS. Should we? By doing so
we're consistent, and also ensuring clients can handle HTTPS for authentication.

## Linking to auxiliary data

In various responses, we provide hyperlinks to auxiliary data. For example, the
artist that a set of artist aliases belong to, or the label that an artist-label
relationship points to. The question is:

1. Do we retain these hyperlinks?
2. Or do we expand these hyperlinks into full objects?

I personally am in favour of 1 (hence writing it so!), and my rationale is as
follows. With aggressive cache control headers, fetching this data can
effectively be reduced to a no-op once the client has requested this data
once. As per [rate limiting](#rate-limiting), requesting something that hits the
cache does not cost against the rate limiter. Thus this data is usable by
clients at almost no cost, and the data only has to be transmitted once, rather
than multiple times.

## Pagination - page based or reference based?

There are 2 ways to handle pagination, with different advantages and
disadvantages. The most common way is to use a limit/offset (or page). The other
method is to keep track of the last item on a page and pass that reference
itself to find the next page.

### Page based

* Fairly common.
* Allows jumping to the last page.
* O(1) queries to find the `nth` item.
* Requires the whole query executed either in full (without limits) or twice, in
  order to obtain the count.
* Can be influenced between requests by data changing.

### Offset

* O(n) queries to look up the `nth` item.
* Can take advantage of limit/offset, though still needs another query to get
  the total count.
* Not as susceptible to data changing - the offset is still valid.

## text/html for annotations?

The annotation end point could also be extended to Accept: text/html, in order
to produce rendered annotations. This might be useful to some people, but
specifically useful to the web-site if we want to start dog fooding our own web
service.

## Usage of Link header

[RFC-5988][] re-defines the Link header, providing a structured language for
linking to other resources. In the responses above, I specifically embed the URI
to sub-resources, and next/previous page. Perhaps this data would be more useful
in the Link header?

[RFC-5988]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5988
